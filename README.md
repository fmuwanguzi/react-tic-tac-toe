## Write a brief `reflection` on what you learned from this tutorial here:

#### Notes

React is a javascript library for building user interfaces.

`React.Componenent` is a componenet that takes in `props` ('properties) returns a hierarchy of views that can be displayed using render.

JSX comes with the full power of javascripts for example 
```js
return React.createElement('div', {className: 'shopping-list'},
  React.createElement('h1', /* ... h1 children ... */),
  React.createElement('ul', /* ... ul children ... */)
);
```

Good testing method for a click event listener is `onClick={()=>alert('click')}` It rendered a prompt on the page that showed click when I clicked on each box.
